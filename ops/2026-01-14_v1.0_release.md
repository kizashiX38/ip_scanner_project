# Ops Report: v1.0.0 Release Preparation and Publishing
**Date:** 2026-01-14  
**Task:** Sanitize personal info, create v1.0 release package, and publish to GitHub

## Summary
Successfully sanitized all personal information from the codebase, created comprehensive release documentation, and published v1.0.0 release to GitHub with proper packaging for easy user installation.

## Personal Information Sanitization

### Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Network Interface Names** (CRITICAL)
   - **Found**: Hardcoded interface names `enxa453eed5dd26` and `wlp99s0` in scripts
   - **Risk**: These contain MAC address components and are hardware-specific
   - **Fix**: Replaced with auto-detection code:
     ```bash
     # Auto-detect network interfaces (exclude loopback)
     INTERFACES=($(ip link show | grep -E "^[0-9]+:" | grep -v "lo:" | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/:$//' | head -2))
     # Fallback to common interface names if auto-detection fails
     if [ ${#INTERFACES[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
         INTERFACES=("eth0" "wlan0")
     fi
     ```
   - **Files Modified**:
     - `scripts/scan_subnets_enhanced.sh`
     - `scripts/scan_subnets.sh`

2. **Personal Hostnames** (MEDIUM)
   - **Found**: Personal device hostname `dxm-ROG-Zephyrus-G16-GA605WI` in ops documentation
   - **Risk**: Identifies specific user hardware
   - **Fix**: Replaced with generic placeholders:
     - `dxm-ROG-Zephyrus-G16-GA605WI` → `laptop-hostname`
     - `dxm-ROG-Zephyrus-G16-GA605WI-GA605WI` → `device-hostname`
   - **Files Modified**:
     - `ops/2026-01-14_network_scan.md`

### Verification
- ✅ No personal usernames found
- ✅ No passwords or API keys found
- ✅ No personal IP addresses (only example ranges)
- ✅ All hardware-specific identifiers removed
- ✅ All personal hostnames sanitized
